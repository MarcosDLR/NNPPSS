# NNPPSS

### Description

The **NNPPSS** application is a tool designed for the management and download of files related to PlayStation Vita. It is developed in Java and uses the Swing graphical library for the user interface.

### Main Features

2. **Filtering and Searching**: Users can filter and search for games in the loaded database. Filtering can be done by text and by region.

3. **Interaction with Data Table**: Users can select games from a data table to view detailed information about them and, in some cases, download the game directly from the application.
